# Overview

This is a repository for hosting a website for comparing React and Vue.js as a mono repo that uses a shell app to include both web solutions.
The site itself is made in Vue, but the examples for the pages will be done in both Vue and React.

The resulting website will be a comparison of the two web solutions based on scholarly and industry documentation/articles. The idea is that this will result in a mostly unbiased comparison that seeks to explain their differences to remain as impartial as possible. This should allow developers to not only learn more about these solutions but also have a better understanding that allows them to choose more wisely.
